# OpenStack Debugging - Setup

For the OpenStack debugging session, you need to install devstack with PyCharm IDE. There are many options but we recommend one of the following:

1. Create a VirtualBox VM from the provided OVA file
2. Create a VM on the local PC/MAC and install devstack & PyCharm manually
3. Use a remove VM on a cloud

Option 1 is the easiest and can be setup on PC/MAC. All you have to do is install VirtualBox and then import the OVA file. This will create a VM that has everything you need - Ubuntu 14.04, Devstack, PyCharm and Debug configuration.

If you are having issues downloading the huge OVA file, consider installing from scratch. Please instructions [here](http://wiringtheplanet.blogspot.com/2016/09/installing-devstack-and-pycharm-for.html?view=classic).

The final option is using a VM on a cloud such as AWS, GCE or any public cloud.
